# what is python programming language?
# Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility.
# It is used in various fields such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

# installing python
# You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
# we installed the visual studio code editor to write and run python code.

# verify python installation
# Open a terminal or command prompt and type:
# python --version
# or
# python3 --version

# writing your first python program
# print("Hello, World!")


# running your python program
# Save your code in a file named main.py and run it using the command:
# python main.py
# or
# python3 main.py   

#  1st Topic: Variables and Data Types & Input/Output Operations

# 1. Variables and Data Types
# Variables are used to store data in a program. Python supports various data types including:

# name = "Alice"  
# print(name)  

# Data Types:
# String: Text data, e.g., "Hello"
# Integer: Whole numbers, e.g., 42
# Float: Decimal numbers, e.g., 3.14
# Boolean: True or False values, e.g., True

# Example of different data types
# name = "Alice"        # String
# age = 30              # Integer
# height = 5.5         # Float
# is_student = False    # Boolean

# print(name)
# print(age)
# print(height)
# print(is_student)

# Operations on Variables
# You can perform various operations on variables, such as arithmetic operations for numbers and concatenation for strings.
# three operators are
# Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %
# Comparison Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
# Logical Operators: and, or, not


# explanation of operators
# Arithmetic Operators
#  it includes addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%).
# Example:
a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)  # Addition
print(a - b)  # Subtraction
print(a * b)  # Multiplication
print(a / b)  # Division
print(a % b)  # Modulus
